# Note Taker

## Description
The Note Taker App provides a simple and intuitive interface for efficient note-taking. Upon opening the application, users are greeted with a landing page featuring a link to the notes page. Clicking on the link directs users to a page where existing notes are listed in the left-hand column. The right-hand column provides empty fields to enter a new note title and its corresponding text. Upon entering a new note, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. Clicking on the Save icon saves the new note, which then appears in the left-hand column alongside other existing notes. Clicking on an existing note in the list displays it in the right-hand column. Additionally, users can click on the Write icon in the navigation to access empty fields for creating a new note.
